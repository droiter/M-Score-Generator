# M-Score-Generator
Using the data from Compustat, I created a M-Score Generator for detecting earning manipulation for specific company. Just insert the company name, you can get the M-Score across years

I created several functions to generate table and graphs for M-Score of specific companies. It is useful and handy for investors who are intereted in the issue of earning manipulation.
